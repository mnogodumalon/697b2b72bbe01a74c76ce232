Your goal is to create dashboards that feel like **top-rated apps from the App Store** - polished, intuitive, and memorable.\n\nYour output is `design_brief.md` - a detailed, written specification that the implementation agent will follow exactly.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Why Markdown, Not JSON\n\nYou write a **design brief** in Markdown because:\n\n1. **Explains WHY** - You can explain your reasoning, which helps the implementer understand intent\n2. **Reads as instructions** - The implementer treats it as guidance, not just data\n3. **Allows nuance** - You can describe visual details that don't fit in JSON fields\n4. **Prevents misinterpretation** - Explicit descriptions leave no room for \"creative interpretation\"\n\n---\n\n## Design Standard: App Store Quality\n\nYour designs must meet the quality bar of **the best apps in the App Store**:\n\n- **Layouts that feel native** to each device (not just \"responsive\")\n- **Information architecture** that makes sense instantly\n- **Touch targets and interactions** designed for each platform\n- **Visual hierarchy** that guides the eye naturally\n- **Distinctive details** that make the app memorable\n\nAsk yourself: **\"Would Apple feature this in the App Store?\"** If no, redesign.\n\n---\n\n## Theme: Light, Minimal, BUT Distinctive\n\n**Always use light mode.** But minimal does NOT mean generic or boring.\n\n### The Balance\n\n- **Minimalist** - Every element has a purpose, no clutter\n- **Modern** - Clean lines, subtle shadows, refined typography\n- **Neutral** - Calm, professional base\n- **BUT Distinctive** - One or two memorable details that make it special\n\n### What Makes a Minimal Design Distinctive?\n\nGreat minimal apps have subtle touches that create personality:\n\n1. **A refined color accent** - Not generic blue, but a carefully chosen tone\n2. **Thoughtful typography** - Font weight, size, and spacing that feels considered\n3. **Subtle texture or depth** - Light gradients, gentle shadows, or background patterns\n4. **Micro-details** - Icon style, border radius, spacing rhythm\n5. **Intentional white space** - Not just \"empty\" but compositionally balanced\n\n### Color Philosophy for Light Theme\n\nStart with a warm or cool base, not pure white:\n- **Warm base**: Off-white with slight cream/yellow undertone\n- **Cool base**: Off-white with slight blue/gray undertone\n\nThen add ONE carefully chosen accent color:\n- Not generic blue (#007bff) or green (#28a745)\n- Pick a specific, refined tone that fits the app's domain\n- Use sparingly - accent highlights important elements\n\n### Typography Philosophy\n\n**FORBIDDEN FONTS:** Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Arial, Helvetica, system-ui\n\nThese fonts are so common they signal \"no design thought went into this.\"\n\n**Choose fonts that add character while remaining readable:**\n\n| App Character | Recommended Fonts |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| Data/Analytics | Space Grotesk, IBM Plex Sans, Geist |\n| Fitness/Health | Outfit, Nunito Sans, DM Sans |\n| Finance | Source Serif 4, Newsreader, IBM Plex Serif |\n| Creative | Syne, Bricolage Grotesque, Cabinet Grotesk |\n| Professional | Source Sans 3, Plus Jakarta Sans, Manrope |\n\n**Typography creates hierarchy through:**\n- Extreme weight differences (300 vs 700, not 400 vs 500)\n- Size jumps (24px vs 14px, not 16px vs 14px)\n- Careful letter-spacing adjustments\n\n---\n\n## Layout Design (MOST IMPORTANT!)\n\nLayout is the foundation of good UX. Spend the most time here.\n\n**⚠️ The #1 reason dashboards look like \"AI slop\" is a boring, symmetrical grid layout.** Real designers create visual tension and flow. Your layout must feel hand-crafted by a senior product designer for THIS specific app.\n\n### Think Like a Product Designer\n\nBefore drawing anything, answer:\n\n1. **What is the ONE thing users must see first?**\n   - This becomes your hero element - the visual anchor\n   - Everything else supports this\n\n2. **What actions do users take most often?**\n   - The #1 action becomes your Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n   - Maximum 1-2 taps/clicks to reach\n   - Position for thumb reach on mobile\n   - This dashboard is interactive, NOT read-only!\n\n3. **What is the user's mental model?**\n   - How do they naturally think about this data?\n   - Your layout should mirror their thinking\n\n4. **What is the user's workflow?**\n   - What sequence of actions do they take?\n   - How can the layout support this flow?\n\n---\n\n### Creating Visual Interest\n\nThe goal is a layout that feels **intentionally designed for THIS app**, not a generic template.\n\n**The core principle:** Every layout needs at least ONE element that creates visual interest - something that breaks the monotony of identical boxes. This could be:\n\n- **Size variation** - One element noticeably larger than others (the hero)\n- **Weight variation** - Mix of bold and subtle elements\n- **Spacing variation** - Tighter grouping within sections, more space between\n- **Format variation** - Mix of cards, inline text, badges (not everything in cards)\n- **Typography variation** - Different sizes that create clear hierarchy\n\n### Symmetric vs Asymmetric Layouts\n\n**Both can work well.** Choose based on what suits the app:\n\n**Symmetric layouts work when:**\n- The app has 2-4 equally important metrics\n- The data is naturally balanced (e.g., income vs expenses)\n- A calm, orderly feel fits the app's purpose\n\n**Asymmetric layouts work when:**\n- There's ONE thing that matters most (clear hero)\n- You want to create visual flow/movement\n- The data has natural hierarchy\n\n**Either way, add visual interest:**\n- If symmetric: vary element sizes, use different treatments for hero\n- If asymmetric: make the hierarchy obvious through sizing\n\n### What Makes a Layout Feel Generic\n\nAvoid these patterns that scream \"AI-generated template\":\n\n- **Everything the same size** - All KPIs identical, all cards identical\n- **No clear hero** - Nothing stands out as most important\n- **Uniform spacing everywhere** - No visual grouping\n- **Only cards** - No inline elements, no variation in container styles\n- **No breathing room** - Elements crammed together without whitespace\n\n### Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\nDesign mobile as a **completely separate experience**, not a squeezed desktop.\n\n**Mobile Principles:**\n- **Vertical flow** - One column, top to bottom\n- **Thumb-friendly** - Important actions in bottom half\n- **Focused** - Show less, but show it well\n- **Progressive** - Reveal details on interaction\n- **Hero stands out** - Make the most important element visually dominant\n\n**Mobile Questions:**\n- What needs to be LARGER for comfortable touch?\n- Where should the primary action live? (Thumb zone)\n- How does the hero stand out from other content?\n- How should content be reorganized to fit the vertical flow?\n\nNote: Only hide elements on mobile if they're truly impossible to use on a phone. Users expect the same functionality on all devices.\n\n**Mobile Layout Ideas:**\n- Hero KPI takes entire top fold, everything else scrolls below\n- Compact horizontal scroll for secondary KPIs\n- Inline summary row (not cards) for quick stats\n- Bottom sheet for additional details\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\nDesign desktop to take full advantage of horizontal space.\n\n**Desktop Principles:**\n- **Use the width** - Multi-column layouts where appropriate\n- **Horizontal density** - Side-by-side information\n- **Hover reveals** - Secondary info on hover\n- **Peripheral vision** - Context without overwhelming\n- **Keyboard awareness** - Power user shortcuts\n\n**Desktop Questions:**\n- How does the extra width add value? (Not just stretching)\n- Which side gets the hero element?\n- What information benefits from side-by-side comparison?\n- What hover states add useful information?\n- Where can you break the grid intentionally?\n\n**Desktop Layout Ideas:**\n- Wide left column (hero + chart) + narrow right column (recent activity)\n- Full-width hero banner, then 3 unequal columns below\n- Sidebar with key stats, main area with detailed views\n- Sticky summary header while scrolling through details\n\n---\n\n## Information Hierarchy\n\nUsers scan, they don't read. Design for scanning.\n\n**Hierarchy Levels:**\n1. **Primary** - ONE thing that matters most (largest, boldest)\n2. **Secondary** - Supporting information (medium)\n3. **Tertiary** - Details, metadata (smallest, muted)\n\n**Hierarchy Tools:**\n- Size (larger = more important)\n- Weight (bolder = more important)\n- Color (accent = important/interactive)\n- Position (top/left = seen first)\n- Space (more whitespace = more important)\n\n---\n\n## Your Output: design_brief.md\n\nWrite a detailed design brief in Markdown.

What proportions?\n- Where does the eye go first, second, third?\n- What creates visual interest in this layout?]\n\n### Section Layout\n[Describe what goes where:\n- Top area: [what content]\n- Main content area: [what content]\n- Supporting areas: [what content]\nInclude proportions if using multi-column layout.]\n\n### What Appears on Hover\n[What extra information is revealed when hovering over elements?]\n\n### Clickable/Interactive Areas (if applicable)\n[If any elements should open detail views when clicked, note them here.\nOnly add where it provides additional useful information.]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Components\n\n### Hero KPI\nThe MOST important metric that users see first.\n\n- **Title:** [Name]\n- **Data source:** [Which app to query]\n- **Calculation:** [How to calculate: sum, count, latest, etc.]\n- **Display:** [How it looks - large number? With icon? Progress ring?]\n- **Context shown:** [What comparison? Goal progress? Trend?]\n- **Why this is the hero:** [Explain why this matters most to users]\n\n### Secondary KPIs\n[For each secondary KPI:]\n\n**[KPI Name]**\n- Source: [App]\n- Calculation: [How]\n- Format: [number/currency/percent]\n- Display: [Card? Inline? Size?]\n\n### Chart (if applicable)\n- **Type:** [line/bar/area - and WHY this type]\n- **Title:** [Chart title]\n- **What question it answers:** [Why does the user need this chart?]\n- **Data source:** [App]\n- **X-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Y-axis:** [Field, label]\n- **Mobile simplification:** [How is it simplified for small screens?]\n\n### Lists/Tables (if applicable)\n[For each list:]\n\n**[Section Name]**\n- Purpose: [Why users need this]\n- Source: [App]\n- Fields shown: [Which fields]\n- Mobile style: [cards/simple list]\n- Desktop style: [table/cards]\n- Sort: [By what field]\n- Limit: [How many items]\n\n### Primary Action Button (REQUIRED!)\n\n**⚠️ Every dashboard MUST have a primary action.** This is NOT a read-only view!\n\nUsers need to DO things from the dashboard, not just look at data. The most common action should be one tap/click away.\n\nThink about what action users perform most often:\n- Adding a new record (workout, meal, expense, etc.)\n- Logging something (weight, progress, status)\n- Starting a process (timer, session, etc.)\n\n**This section is REQUIRED - do not skip it or write \"None\"!**\n\n- **Label:** [Action-oriented text, e.g. \"Workout starten\", \"Mahlzeit hinzufügen\"]\n- **Action:** [add_record | navigate - specify which]\n- **Target app:** [Which Living Apps app receives the data]\n- **What data:** [What fields will the form contain]\n- **Mobile position:** [bottom_fixed (recommended) | header | fab]\n- **Desktop position:** [header | sidebar | inline]\n- **Why this action:** [Why is this the most important thing users do?]\n\nThe implementation skill knows how to create forms that send data to Living Apps API.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Visual Details\n\n### Border Radius\n[sharp (4px) / rounded (8px) / pill (16px+)]\n\n### Shadows\n[none / subtle / elevated - describe the shadow style]\n\n### Spacing\n[compact / normal / spacious - how much breathing room?]\n\n### Animations\n- **Page load:** [none / fade / stagger]\n- **Hover effects:** [What happens on hover?]\n- **Tap feedback:** [What happens on tap?]\n\n---\n\n## 8. CSS Variables (Copy Exactly!)\n\nThe implementer MUST copy these values exactly into `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  --card: hsl(...);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --popover: hsl(...);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --primary: hsl(...);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --secondary: hsl(...);\n  --secondary-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --muted: hsl(...);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --accent: hsl(...);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(...);\n  --destructive: hsl(...);\n  --border: hsl(...);\n  --input: hsl(...);\n  --ring: hsl(...);\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 9. Implementation Checklist\n\nThe implementer should verify:\n- [ ] Font loaded from URL above\n- [ ] All CSS variables copied exactly\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element is prominent as described\n- [ ] Colors create the mood described in Section 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ How Colors Are Applied (Critical!)\n\nYour colors are mapped to CSS variables. The implementation agent uses them directly.\n\n**Color Mapping:**\n\n| Your design_brief color | CSS Variable |\n|-------------------------|--------------|\n| `background` | `--background` |\n| `foreground` | `--foreground` |\n| `card` | `--card` |\n| `card_foreground` | `--card-foreground` |\n| `primary` | `--primary` |\n| `primary_foreground` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| `accent` | `--accent` |\n| `muted` | `--muted` |\n| `muted_foreground` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| `border` | `--border` |\n| `negative` | `--destructive` |\n\n**Light Theme Contrast Rules:**\n- `foreground` must be dark (readable on light backgrounds)\n- `card` can be white or slightly off-white\n- `card_foreground` must be dark\n- `primary` needs sufficient contrast for buttons\n\n**All colors MUST be complete hsl() functions:**\n```\n\"background\": \"hsl(40 20% 98%)\"   // ✅ Complete function\n\"background\": \"40 20% 98%\"        // ❌ Will break!\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quality Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing design_brief.md:\n\n### Distinctiveness\n- [ ] Would a designer recognize this as intentionally designed (not default)?\n- [ ] Is there at least ONE memorable visual detail?\n- [ ] Is the font choice appropriate and NOT from forbidden list?\n- [ ] Does the color accent feel considered, not generic?\n\n### Layout & UX (CRITICAL FOR AVOIDING AI SLOP!)\n- [ ] Is there ONE clear hero element that stands out?\n- [ ] Is there visual interest? (size variation, typography hierarchy, spacing variation)\n- [ ] NOT everything the same size - some variation exists\n- [ ] Is mobile designed FOR mobile (not just smaller)?\n- [ ] Does desktop use horizontal space meaningfully?\n- [ ] Would this get featured in the App Store?\n\n### Interactivity\n- [ ] Is the primary action clearly defined?\n- [ ] Are clickable elements marked where drill-down adds value?\n\n### Information\n- [ ] Is the visual hierarchy clear?\n- [ ] Are all relevant KPIs included?\n\n### Clarity\n- [ ] Is every section detailed enough that someone else could implement it?\n- [ ] Are there WHY explanations for major decisions?\n- [ ] Are the CSS variables complete and ready to copy?\n- [ ] Is the Layout Strategy section filled out with specific proportions?\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] Are all colors complete hsl() functions?\n- [ ] Is contrast sufficient for readability?\n- [ ] Are all required colors defined?\n\n---\n\n## Remember\n\n1. **Write for the implementer** - They will follow your words exactly\n2. **Explain WHY** - Context helps them understand intent\n3. **Be specific** - \"Large number\" is vague, \"48px bold\" is specific\n4. **Minimal ≠ Generic** - Minimal can be distinctive\n5. **Layout is everything** - 80% of design time on layout\n6. **Visual interest is required** - Vary sizes, not everything identical\n7. **Mobile ≠ Small Desktop** - Separate experiences\n8. **One memorable detail** - What makes this special?\n9. **App Store quality** - Would Apple feature this?\n","numLines":613,"startLine":1,"totalLines":613}}}

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a tool management system (\"Werkzeugverwaltung\") for what appears to be an electrical installation and construction company. It tracks tools (Werkzeuge) across different storage locations (Lagerorte), manages tool checkouts to employees (Werkzeugausgabe), and records returns with condition assessments (Werkzeugrückgabe). The system also tracks DGUV V3 inspection requirements for electrical equipment.\n\n### Who Uses This\nA workshop manager, warehouse supervisor, or site foreman who needs to:\n- Know which tools are currently checked out and to whom\n- Track tools that are overdue for return\n- Monitor upcoming DGUV V3 inspections (legal requirement in Germany)\n- Quickly issue or return tools\n- See the overall status of the tool inventory\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Where are my tools right now, and which ones need attention?\"**\n\nThe user opens this dashboard to immediately see:\n1. How many tools are currently out (checked out)\n2. Which tools are overdue\n3. Which tools need inspection soon\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\nUsers need to perform these actions most often:\n\n1. **Werkzeug ausgeben** (Issue a tool) → Primary Action Button\n   - This is the #1 action - someone comes to the workshop and needs a tool\n2. **Werkzeug zurückgeben** (Return a tool) → Secondary action\n   - When someone brings a tool back\n3. View tool details → Click on a tool in the list\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis dashboard uses an **industrial-professional aesthetic** that feels appropriate for a workshop environment. The warm stone-gray tones with a strong amber/orange accent evoke tools, safety equipment, and industrial settings. It's serious and functional, but the amber accent adds energy and helps critical warnings (overdue, inspection needed) stand out naturally. The design feels like it belongs in a Werkstatt, not a generic SaaS product.\n\n### Layout Strategy\nThe layout is **asymmetric with a clear hero section**:\n- **Hero element**: A large status overview showing the 3 most critical numbers (Werkzeuge ausgegeben, Überfällig, Prüfung fällig) takes visual prominence at the top\n- The hero uses **bold typography and color-coded indicators** - the count of overdue/inspection-due items uses the amber accent for warning\n- **Below the hero**: A two-column layout on desktop with \"Aktuelle Ausgaben\" (current checkouts) taking 60% width and \"Prüfungen fällig\" (inspections due) taking 40%\n- **Visual interest through size variation**: The hero numbers are dramatically large (48px+), secondary metrics are medium, and table text is compact\n- **Mobile reorganizes to vertical flow** with hero at top, then stacked sections\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **hero status cards use a distinctive \"status pill\" design** - each KPI has a rounded left edge with a colored indicator bar (green for OK, amber for warning, red for critical). This creates a visual \"traffic light\" effect that communicates status instantly without reading numbers. The indicator bar is 4px wide and uses rounded caps, creating a refined industrial meter aesthetic.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Space Grotesk\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Space Grotesk has a technical, industrial quality that suits a tool management system. Its geometric forms feel modern yet workmanlike. The distinct numerals make data easy to scan quickly.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(30 10% 96%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(30 5% 15%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(30 5% 15%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(30 10% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action (amber) | `hsl(32 95% 44%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(32 90% 95%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(30 10% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(30 5% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive (available) | `hsl(142 70% 35%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning (overdue/inspection) | `hsl(32 95% 44%)` | (matches primary) |\n| Error/negative (critical) | `hsl(0 70% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm stone-gray background (`hsl(30 10% 96%)`) has a subtle warmth that feels industrial without being cold. The amber primary (`hsl(32 95% 44%)`) is reminiscent of safety equipment, warning signs, and the warmth of workshop lighting. It's bold enough to draw attention but professional enough for a business tool. The green success color is used sparingly for \"available\" or \"OK\" status.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white/stone color (`hsl(30 10% 96%)`). Cards are pure white to create subtle elevation. No gradients or patterns - the industrial aesthetic benefits from clean, solid surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile uses a **single-column vertical flow** with the hero status section dominating the first viewport. The 3 key metrics stack horizontally in a compact row, making status visible immediately.

App Analysis\n\n### What This App Does\nThis is a tool management system (\"Werkzeugverwaltung\") for what appears to be an electrical installation and construction company. It tracks tools (Werkzeuge) across different storage locations (Lagerorte), manages tool checkouts to employees (Werkzeugausgabe), and records returns with condition assessments (Werkzeugrückgabe). The system also tracks DGUV V3 inspection requirements for electrical equipment.\n\n### Who Uses This\nA workshop manager, warehouse supervisor, or site foreman who needs to:\n- Know which tools are currently checked out and to whom\n- Track tools that are overdue for return\n- Monitor upcoming DGUV V3 inspections (legal requirement in Germany)\n- Quickly issue or return tools\n- See the overall status of the tool inventory\n\n### The ONE Thing Users Care About Most\n**\"Where are my tools right now, and which ones need attention?\"**\n\nThe user opens this dashboard to immediately see:\n1. How many tools are currently out (checked out)\n2. Which tools are overdue\n3. Which tools need inspection soon\n\n### Primary Actions (IMPORTANT!)\nUsers need to perform these actions most often:\n\n1. **Werkzeug ausgeben** (Issue a tool) → Primary Action Button\n   - This is the #1 action - someone comes to the workshop and needs a tool\n2. **Werkzeug zurückgeben** (Return a tool) → Secondary action\n   - When someone brings a tool back\n3. View tool details → Click on a tool in the list\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Makes This Design Distinctive\n\n### Visual Identity\nThis dashboard uses an **industrial-professional aesthetic** that feels appropriate for a workshop environment. The warm stone-gray tones with a strong amber/orange accent evoke tools, safety equipment, and industrial settings. It's serious and functional, but the amber accent adds energy and helps critical warnings (overdue, inspection needed) stand out naturally. The design feels like it belongs in a Werkstatt, not a generic SaaS product.\n\n### Layout Strategy\nThe layout is **asymmetric with a clear hero section**:\n- **Hero element**: A large status overview showing the 3 most critical numbers (Werkzeuge ausgegeben, Überfällig, Prüfung fällig) takes visual prominence at the top\n- The hero uses **bold typography and color-coded indicators** - the count of overdue/inspection-due items uses the amber accent for warning\n- **Below the hero**: A two-column layout on desktop with \"Aktuelle Ausgaben\" (current checkouts) taking 60% width and \"Prüfungen fällig\" (inspections due) taking 40%\n- **Visual interest through size variation**: The hero numbers are dramatically large (48px+), secondary metrics are medium, and table text is compact\n- **Mobile reorganizes to vertical flow** with hero at top, then stacked sections\n\n### Unique Element\nThe **hero status cards use a distinctive \"status pill\" design** - each KPI has a rounded left edge with a colored indicator bar (green for OK, amber for warning, red for critical). This creates a visual \"traffic light\" effect that communicates status instantly without reading numbers. The indicator bar is 4px wide and uses rounded caps, creating a refined industrial meter aesthetic.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Theme & Colors\n\n### Font\n- **Family:** Space Grotesk\n- **URL:** `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Space+Grotesk:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap`\n- **Why this font:** Space Grotesk has a technical, industrial quality that suits a tool management system. Its geometric forms feel modern yet workmanlike. The distinct numerals make data easy to scan quickly.\n\n### Color Palette\nAll colors as complete hsl() functions:\n\n| Purpose | Color | CSS Variable |\n|---------|-------|--------------|\n| Page background | `hsl(30 10% 96%)` | `--background` |\n| Main text | `hsl(30 5% 15%)` | `--foreground` |\n| Card background | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--card` |\n| Card text | `hsl(30 5% 15%)` | `--card-foreground` |\n| Borders | `hsl(30 10% 88%)` | `--border` |\n| Primary action (amber) | `hsl(32 95% 44%)` | `--primary` |\n| Text on primary | `hsl(0 0% 100%)` | `--primary-foreground` |\n| Accent highlight | `hsl(32 90% 95%)` | `--accent` |\n| Muted background | `hsl(30 10% 94%)` | `--muted` |\n| Muted text | `hsl(30 5% 45%)` | `--muted-foreground` |\n| Success/positive (available) | `hsl(142 70% 35%)` | (component use) |\n| Warning (overdue/inspection) | `hsl(32 95% 44%)` | (matches primary) |\n| Error/negative (critical) | `hsl(0 70% 50%)` | `--destructive` |\n\n### Why These Colors\nThe warm stone-gray background (`hsl(30 10% 96%)`) has a subtle warmth that feels industrial without being cold. The amber primary (`hsl(32 95% 44%)`) is reminiscent of safety equipment, warning signs, and the warmth of workshop lighting. It's bold enough to draw attention but professional enough for a business tool. The green success color is used sparingly for \"available\" or \"OK\" status.\n\n### Background Treatment\nThe page background uses a warm off-white/stone color (`hsl(30 10% 96%)`). Cards are pure white to create subtle elevation. No gradients or patterns - the industrial aesthetic benefits from clean, solid surfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Mobile Layout (Phone)\n\n### Layout Approach\nMobile uses a **single-column vertical flow** with the hero status section dominating the first viewport. The 3 key metrics stack horizontally in a compact row, making status visible immediately. Below, content sections stack vertically with clear section headers.\n\n### What Users See (Top to Bottom)\n\n**Header:**\n- App title \"Werkzeugverwaltung\" left-aligned, medium weight\n- Primary action button \"Ausgeben\" (amber, pill-shaped) right-aligned\n- Compact height (56px)\n\n**Hero Section (Status Overview):**\n- Takes approximately 30% of viewport height\n- Three status cards in a horizontal row (equal width, ~33% each)\n- Each card shows:\n  - Large number (32px, bold)\n  - Label below (12px, muted)\n  - Left border indicator (4px, color-coded)\n- Cards: \"Ausgegeben\" (checked out), \"Überfällig\" (overdue), \"Prüfung fällig\" (inspection due)\n- Why hero: Instantly answers \"what needs my attention?\"\n\n**Section 2: Aktuelle Ausgaben (Current Checkouts)**\n- Section header: \"Aktuelle Ausgaben\" with count badge\n- Scrollable list of checkout cards\n- Each card shows:\n  - Tool name (bold)\n  - Employee name\n  - Checkout date\n  - Days out / status (overdue highlighted in amber)\n- Maximum 5 items shown, \"Alle anzeigen\" link for more\n- Cards have subtle shadow and rounded corners\n\n**Section 3: Prüfungen fällig (Inspections Due)**\n- Section header: \"Prüfungen fällig\" with count badge\n- Compact list format (not cards)\n- Each row: Tool name, inspection date, days until due\n- Items due within 7 days highlighted with amber background\n- Items overdue highlighted with red text\n\n**Bottom Navigation / Action:**\n- Fixed bottom action bar (height 72px, white with top shadow)\n- Primary button: \"Werkzeug ausgeben\" (full width, amber)\n- This ensures the #1 action is always one tap away\n\n### Mobile-Specific Adaptations\n- Hero cards become compact horizontal pills\n- Table views transform to card lists\n- Touch targets minimum 44px\n- Section content limited to 5 items with \"show more\"\n\n### Touch Targets\n- All interactive elements minimum 44px touch target\n- Cards have full-surface tap area\n- List rows have generous padding (16px vertical)\n\n### Interactive Elements\n- Tapping a checkout card shows tool details modal\n- Tapping an inspection item shows tool details modal\n\n---\n\n## 5.

Pay attention to:\n\n- **Section 3: Theme & Colors** → Font name, URL, and all color values\n- **Section 4: Mobile Layout** → Exact structure for phone screens\n- **Section 5: Desktop Layout** → Exact structure for computer screens\n- **Section 6: Components** → Hero KPI, secondary KPIs, charts, lists\n- **Section 7: Visual Details** → Border radius, shadows, animations\n- **Section 8: CSS Variables** → Copy these EXACTLY into src/index.css\n\nThe brief explains WHY decisions were made. This helps you understand intent, but your job is to implement what is written, not to interpret.\n\n### Step 2: Read Existing Code\n\n```bash\ncat src/types/*.ts\ncat src/services/livingAppsService.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Apply CSS Variables FIRST (CRITICAL!)\n\nBefore writing any React code, update the theme. Copy the CSS from **Section 8** of design_brief.md into `src/index.css`.\n\nshadcn/ui components use Tailwind CSS variables. If you don't update them, `<Card>`, `<Button>`, etc. will use **default colors** that don't match the design!\n\n```\ndesign_brief.md → src/index.css → Tailwind classes → shadcn components\n   (Section 8)      (CSS variables)   (bg-card, etc.)   (Card, Button)\n```\n\n#### Step 3a: Copy CSS Variables\n\nThe design_brief.md Section 8 contains ready-to-copy CSS. Copy it EXACTLY:\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Copy ALL values from design_brief.md Section 8 */\n  --background: hsl(...);\n  --foreground: hsl(...);\n  /* etc. */\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3b: Light Mode (Always)\n\nThe design brief uses light mode. Make sure `index.html` does NOT have `class=\"dark\"`:\n\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\">  <!-- No \"dark\" class for light theme -->\n```\n\n### Step 4: Add Font\n\nCopy the font URL from **Section 3** of design_brief.md into `index.html`:\n\n```html\n<link href=\"[URL from Section 3]\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 5: Implement Dashboard.tsx\n\nNow implement the React component following the brief:\n\n```typescript\n// 1. Imports (always use 'import type' for types!)\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport type { AppType1, AppType2 } from '@/types/app';\nimport { LivingAppsService } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// 2. Follow Section 4 (Mobile) and Section 5 (Desktop) for layout\n// 3. Follow Section 6 for components (Hero, KPIs, Charts, Lists)\n// 4. Follow Section 7 for visual details (radius, shadows, animations)\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Deploy\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThen call `mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github`\n\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Light mode defaults - used when NO .dark class */\n}\n\n.dark {\n  /* Dark mode - used when <html class=\"dark\"> */\n}\n```\n\n**Color Mapping Table:**\n\n| design_brief.md section | CSS Variable | Used by |\n|----------------------|--------------|---------|\n| `theme.colors.background` | `--background` | `bg-background`, body |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--foreground` | `text-foreground`, body text |\n| `theme.colors.card` | `--card` | `<Card>` background |\n| `theme.colors.foreground` | `--card-foreground` | Text inside cards |\n| `theme.colors.primary` | `--primary` | `<Button>` default |\n| `theme.colors.accent` | `--accent` | Accent elements |\n| `theme.colors.muted` | `--muted` | Muted backgrounds |\n| `theme.colors.border` | `--border` | All borders |\n| `theme.colors.positive` | `--chart-2` | Success/positive in charts |\n| `theme.colors.negative` | `--destructive` | Error/negative |\n\n#### Step 4c: Example - Applying a Dark Theme\n\nIf design_brief.md says:\n```json\n{\n  \"theme\": {\n    \"mode\": \"dark\",\n    \"colors\": {\n      \"background\": \"hsl(215 28% 7%)\",\n      \"foreground\": \"hsl(215 10% 92%)\",\n      \"card\": \"hsl(215 25% 12%)\",\n      \"primary\": \"hsl(25 95% 53%)\",\n      \"accent\": \"hsl(173 80% 45%)\",\n      \"muted\": \"hsl(215 15% 20%)\",\n      \"border\": \"hsl(215 20% 18%)\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen update `src/index.css`:\n\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  --foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --card: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --card-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --popover: hsl(215 25% 12%);\n  --popover-foreground: hsl(215 10% 92%);\n  \n  --primary: hsl(25 95% 53%);\n  --primary-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --accent: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n  --accent-foreground: hsl(215 28% 7%);\n  \n  --muted: hsl(215 15% 20%);\n  --muted-foreground: hsl(215 10% 70%);\n  \n  --border: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --input: hsl(215 20% 18%);\n  --ring: hsl(173 80% 45%);\n}\n```\n\nAnd update `index.html`:\n```html\n<html lang=\"de\" class=\"dark\">\n```\n\n#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: CSS Color Format\n\nThe CSS variables **MUST use complete color functions**, not raw values!\n\n**❌ WRONG - Raw values break Tailwind:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: 220 25% 6%;        /* ❌ Just numbers - NOT a valid CSS color! */\n  --card: 220 20% 10%;             /* ❌ Browser ignores this, uses fallback! */\n}\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - Complete color functions:**\n```css\n.dark {\n  --background: hsl(220 25% 6%);   /* ✓ Complete hsl() function */\n  --card: hsl(220 20% 10%);        /* ✓ Tailwind can use this */\n}\n```\n\n**Why raw values fail:**\n- Tailwind reads `var(--background)` directly for `bg-background`\n- If `--background` is `220 25% 6%` (just numbers), it's NOT a valid CSS color\n- Browser ignores invalid colors → falls back to white/transparent\n- Result: Light backgrounds with dark text = invisible!\n\n**Always copy the FULL hsl() function from design_brief.md Section 8, including the function name!**\n\n#### Why This Matters\n\nWithout this step:\n- `<Card>` uses default background (light/white)\n- Text colors (from design_brief) are for dark backgrounds\n- Result: **Light text on light cards = invisible!**\n\nWith this step:\n- All shadcn components automatically use your theme colors\n- Consistent look across all UI elements\n- No need to add inline styles everywhere\n\n### Step 5: Add Font from Spec\n\nIn `index.html`, add the font URL from design_brief.md Section 3:\n```html\n<link href=\"{font_url from spec}\" rel=\"stylesheet\">\n```\n\n### Step 6: Build and Test\n\n```bash\nnpm run build  # Must compile without errors\n```\n\n### Step 7: Deploy\n\n```\nCall mcp__deploy_tools__deploy_to_github\n```\n\n---\n\n## Critical Implementation Rules\n\n### 1. Type Imports\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\nimport { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nimport type { Workout } from '@/types/app';\n```\n\n### 2. extractRecordId Always Has Null Check\n```typescript\nconst id = extractRecordId(record.fields.relation);\nif (!id) return;  // ✅ Always check!\n```\n\n### 3. Dates Without Seconds\n```typescript\n// For API: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (no seconds!)\nconst dateForAPI = formData.date + 'T12:00';\n```\n\n### 4. Select Never Has Empty Value\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG\n<SelectItem value=\"\">None</SelectItem>\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\n<SelectItem value=\"none\">None</SelectItem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nBefore completing, verify EACH item against design_brief.md:\n\n### Theme Verification (CRITICAL!)\n- [ ] Font in `index.html` is EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 3 (NOT Inter or Roboto!)\n- [ ] Font-family in CSS matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 3\n- [ ] `index.html` has NO \"dark\" class (light theme)\n- [ ] ALL CSS variables in `src/index.css` copied EXACTLY from design_brief.md Section 8\n- [ ] Colors are complete hsl() functions (not raw values)\n\n### Layout Verification\n- [ ] Mobile layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 4\n- [ ] Desktop layout matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 5\n- [ ] Hero element stands out as described\n- [ ] Section order matches the brief\n\n### Components Verification\n- [ ] Hero KPI matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Hero KPI\"\n- [ ] Secondary KPIs match EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n- [ ] Chart matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6 \"Chart\"\n- [ ] Primary action matches EXACTLY design_brief.md Section 6\n\n### Visual Details Verification\n- [ ] Border radius matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Shadow style matches design_brief.md Section 7\n- [ ] Animations match design_brief.md Section 7\n\n### Technical\n- [ ] `npm run build` passes\n- [ ] No console errors\n\n### ⚠️ COMPLETENESS VERIFICATION (CRITICAL!)\n\n**You MUST verify the dashboard is 100% complete before finishing:**\n\n- [ ] **Every app in app_metadata.json is used** - no data sources ignored\n- [ ] **Primary action works** (create new record via dialog/form)\n- [ ] **Data displays correctly** (all KPIs calculated, lists populated)\n- [ ] **All states handled:**\n  - [ ] Loading states for every data fetch\n  - [ ] Empty states with helpful guidance\n  - [ ] Error states with retry options\n- [ ] **Nothing is placeholder:**\n  - [ ] No \"TODO\" comments in code\n  - [ ] No \"Coming soon\" messages\n  - [ ] No hardcoded demo data\n\n**If ANY item above is unchecked, the dashboard is NOT complete. Fix it before deploying.**\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nThe dashboard is complete when:\n\n1. ✅ **User experience excellent**: Intuitive, clear, professional\n2. ✅ **Primary action button works** (with Dialog/Modal)\n3. ✅ All KPIs/Stats calculated correctly\n4. ✅ Loading state works (Skeleton, not empty page)\n5. ✅ Error handling implemented (friendly messages)\n6. ✅ Empty state implemented (helpful placeholders)\n7. ✅ Responsive design (Mobile + Desktop)\n8. ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npm run build`)\n9. ✅ No console errors in browser\n10. ✅ Business logic correct\n11. ✅ Living Apps API rules followed (dates, applookup, response)\n12. ✅ **All features complete** - nothing skipped or left as TODO\n\n---\n\n## Drill-Down: When and How to Use It\n\nDrill-down is useful when there's **more information to show** than fits in the summary view. Don't add it everywhere - only where it adds value.\n\n### When to Use Drill-Down\n\n| Good Use Cases | Skip Drill-Down When... |\n|----------------|------------------------|\n| List item → show full record details | The summary already shows everything |\n| Summary count → show the items being counted | It's a simple, self-explanatory number |\n| Record reference → view the related record | There's no additional detail to show |\n\n### Make It Obvious\n\nIf something is clickable, make it visually clear:\n- Hover effect (shadow, background change)\n- Cursor pointer\n- Underline or chevron icon for \"see more\"\n\n### Implementation Pattern: Clickable List Item\n\n```typescript\n// Use when list items have more details to show\n<div\n  className=\"p-3 rounded-lg hover:bg-muted cursor-pointer transition-colors\"\n  onClick={() => setSelectedRecord(record)}\n>\n  <div className=\"font-medium\">{record.name}</div>\n  <div className=\"text-sm text-muted-foreground\">{record.summary}</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Don't force drill-down everywhere.** A simple KPI that shows \"5 workouts this week\" doesn't need a click handler if there's nothing more to show.\n\n---\n\n## UX Details - Don't Forget!\n\n### Loading States\n```typescript\nif (loading) {\n  return <LoadingState />;  // Use Skeleton, not spinner\n}\n```\n\n### Empty States\n```typescript\nif (data.length === 0) {\n  return (\n    <EmptyState \n      title=\"No data yet\"\n      description=\"Get started by adding your first item\"\n      action={<Button>Add First Item</Button>}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error States\n```typescript\nif (error) {\n  return (\n    <Alert variant=\"destructive\">\n      <AlertCircle className=\"h-4 w-4\" />\n      <AlertTitle>Error</AlertTitle>\n      <AlertDescription>\n        {error.message}\n        <Button variant=\"outline\" onClick={retry}>Try Again</Button>\n      </AlertDescription>\n    </Alert>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Success Feedback\n```typescript\n// Use toast for success messages\nimport { toast } from '@/components/ui/use-toast';\n\ntoast({\n  title: \"Success!\",\n  description: \"Item saved successfully.\",\n});\n```\n\n### Hover States\n```typescript\n// Cards should have hover feedback\n<Card className=\"hover:shadow-md transition-shadow cursor-pointer\">\n```\n\n---\n\n# Living Apps API Reference\n\n## ⚠️ Critical API Rules\n\nThese rules are **non-negotiable**. Breaking them causes runtime errors.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Date Formats\n\nLiving Apps has strict date format requirements:\n\n| Field Type | Format | Example |\n|------------|--------|---------|\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM` | `2025-11-06T12:00` |\n| `date/date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | `2025-11-06` |\n\n### ❌ WRONG\n```typescript\n// Seconds are NOT allowed for datetimeminute!\nconst date = '2025-11-06T12:00:00';  // ❌ Will fail\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT\n```typescript\n// For date/datetimeminute fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum + 'T12:00';  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM\n\n// For date/date fields\nconst dateForAPI = formData.datum;  // ✅ YYYY-MM-DD\n\n// Display in <input type=\"date\">\nconst dateForInput = apiData.datum?.split('T')[0];  // Extract YYYY-MM-DD\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. applookup Fields\n\n`applookup/select` fields store **full URLs** to related records.\n\n### URL Format\n```\nhttps://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Always use extractRecordId()\n\n```typescript\n// ❌ NEVER do this manually\nconst parts = url.split('/');\nconst id = parts[parts.length - 1];  // ❌ Fragile!\n\n// ✅ ALWAYS use the helper function\nimport { extractRecordId } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\nconst recordId = extractRecordId(url);\nif (!recordId) return;  // ✅ Always null-check!\n```\n\n### extractRecordId() Implementation\n```typescript\nexport function extractRecordId(url: string | null | undefined): string | null {\n  if (!url) return null;\n  // Extracts last 24 hex characters (Living Apps Record IDs)\n  const match = url.match(/([a-f0-9]{24})$/i);\n  return match ? match[1] : null;\n}\n```\n\n### Creating applookup Values\n```typescript\nimport { createRecordUrl, APP_IDS } from '@/services/livingAppsService';\n\n// When creating/updating records with applookup fields\nconst data = {\n  kategorie: createRecordUrl(APP_IDS.KATEGORIEN, selectedKategorieId),\n};\n\n// createRecordUrl returns:\n// 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}'\n```\n\n### applookup Can Be Null!\n```typescript\n// ❌ WRONG - Will crash if field is null\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  data[id] = log;  // ❌ Crashes if id is null\n});\n\n// ✅ CORRECT - Defensive programming\nworkoutLogs.forEach((log) => {\n  const id = extractRecordId(log.fields.uebung);\n  if (!id) return;  // ✅ Skip if null\n  if (!data[id]) data[id] = [];\n  data[id].push(log);\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. API Response Format\n\nLiving Apps returns **objects**, not arrays!\n\n### Response Structure\n```typescript\n// API returns:\n{\n  \"690abc123...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T10:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 1\",\n      \"value\": 100\n    }\n  },\n  \"690def456...\": {\n    \"createdat\": \"2025-11-06T11:00:00\",\n    \"updatedat\": null,\n    \"fields\": {\n      \"name\": \"Item 2\",\n      \"value\": 200\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### ❌ WRONG Transformation\n```typescript\n// Loses record_id!\nconst items = Object.values(response);  // ❌ No record_id!\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT Transformation\n```typescript\n// Use Object.entries() to preserve record_id\nconst items = Object.entries(response).map(([record_id, record]) => ({\n  record_id,  // ← From the key\n  createdat: record.createdat,\n  updatedat: record.updatedat,\n  ...record.fields,\n}));\n```\n\n### Why record_id Matters\n- Required for React `key` prop\n- Required for update/delete operations\n- Required for applookup references\n\n---\n\n## 4. API Authentication\n\n```typescript\nconst headers = {\n  'X-API-Key': API_KEY,  // From environment\n  'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n  'Accept': 'application/json',\n};\n```\n\n### Proxy vs Direct URL\n```typescript\n// For API calls (via proxy)\nconst API_BASE = '/api/rest';\n\n// For applookup values (direct)\nconst APPLOOKUP_BASE = 'https://my.living-apps.de/rest';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. CRUD Operations\n\n### GET All Records\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\n```\n\n### GET Single Record\n```typescript\nGET /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n```\n\n### CREATE Record\n```typescript\nPOST /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"New Item\",\n  \"value\": 100\n}\n```\n\n### UPDATE Record\n```typescript\nPATCH /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"value\": 150  // Only changed fields\n}\n```\n\n### DELETE Record\n```typescript\nDELETE /api/rest/apps/{app_id}/records/{record_id}\n\n// Note: DELETE also returns JSON, always call response.json()\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Error Handling\n\n```typescript\nasync function callAPI(method: string, endpoint: string, data?: any) {\n  const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE}${endpoint}`, {\n    method,\n    headers: {\n      'X-API-Key': API_KEY,\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n    },\n    body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined,\n  });\n\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    const errorText = await response.text();\n    throw new Error(`API Error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`);\n  }\n\n  return response.json();  // Always parse JSON, even for DELETE\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Metadata Structure\n\n`app_metadata.json` contains the **complete, real metadata from Living Apps REST API**.\n\n**IMPORTANT:**\n- `controls` is an **OBJECT** (not array!)\n- Each control has `identifier`, `label`, `type`, `subtype`, `fulltype`\n- `lookup/select` has `lookup_data` with all options\n- `applookup/select` has `lookup_app` URL to the linked app\n\n```typescript\n{\n  \"appgroup_id\": \"...\",\n  \"appgroup_name\": \"My App Group\",\n  \"apps\": {\n    \"app_identifier\": {\n      \"app_id\": \"...\",\n      \"name\": \"App Display Name\",\n      \"controls\": {\n        \"control_identifier\": {\n          \"identifier\": \"field_name\",      // Use this as field key\n          \"label\": \"Field Label\",          // Use this for UI display\n          \"type\": \"string\",                // Base type\n          \"subtype\": null,                 // or \"select\", \"textarea\", etc.\n          \"fulltype\": \"string/text\",       // Combined: type/subtype\n          \"lookup_data\": [                 // For lookup/select fields\n            { \"key\": \"option1\", \"value\": \"Option 1\" },\n            { \"key\": \"option2\", \"value\": \"Option 2\" }\n          ],\n          \"lookup_app\": \"https://my.living-apps.de/rest/apps/{app_id}\"  // For applookup\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Common Field Types\n| fulltype | TypeScript | Notes |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| `string/text` | `string` | Plain text |\n| `string/textarea` | `string` | Multiline text |\n| `number/number` | `number` | Numeric |\n| `bool/bool` | `boolean` | True/false |\n| `date/date` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DD |\n| `date/datetimeminute` | `string` | YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM (NO seconds!) |\n| `lookup/select` | `string` | From predefined list (lookup_data) |\n| `applookup/select` | `string \\| null` | URL to another app's record |\n\n### Using Metadata for UI\n```typescript\n// Use field labels for UI\nconst fieldLabel = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.myfield.label;\n\n// Use lookup_data for Select options\nconst options = metadata.apps.myapp.controls.status.lookup_data;\n// → [{ key: \"active\", value: \"Active\" }, { key: \"done\", value: \"Done\" }]\n```\n\n---\n\n# Code Patterns Reference\n\n## Available Libraries\n\n### shadcn/ui Components\n\nAll shadcn components are pre-installed in `/src/components/ui/`\n\n```typescript\nimport { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '@/components/ui/card';\nimport { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';\nimport { Badge } from '@/components/ui/badge';\nimport { Input } from '@/components/ui/input';\nimport { Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue } from '@/components/ui/select';\nimport { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger } from '@/components/ui/dialog';\nimport { Table, TableBody, TableCell, TableHead, TableHeader, TableRow } from '@/components/ui/table';\nimport { Skeleton } from '@/components/ui/skeleton';\nimport { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from '@/components/ui/alert';\n// etc.\n```\n\n**To find specific components or examples, use shadcn MCP Tools:**\n```\nmcp_shadcn_search_items_in_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'chart')\nmcp_shadcn_view_items_in_registries(items: ['@shadcn/card'])\nmcp_shadcn_get_item_examples_from_registries(registries: ['@shadcn'], query: 'card-demo')\n```\n\n### recharts (Charts)\n\nPre-installed!
