I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I specialize in navigating and exploring codebases.\n\nI understand:\n- I'm in READ-ONLY mode - I cannot create, modify, or delete files\n- I can use Glob, Grep, and Read for searching and analyzing code\n- I can use Bash only for read-only operations\n- I should return absolute file paths in my responses\n- I'm working in the `/home/user/app` directory\n\nI've also reviewed the project instructions from CLAUDE.md. This is a React Dashboard Generator for Living Apps Backend using:\n- React 18 + TypeScript (Vite)\n- shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS v4\n- recharts for charts\n- date-fns for date formatting\n\nThe workflow emphasizes designing first, then implementing dashboards based on user needs and app metadata.\n\nI'm ready to help you search through the codebase or answer questions about the project.
